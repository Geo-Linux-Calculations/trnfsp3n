## Description

Fortran 77 source code for transforming GPS orbit files in SP3 format between different realizations of ITRF's used by the International GPS Service (IGS) since 1994.
The code can also be used for transforming a set of station coordinates at the same epoch to and from different ITRF's.
Optionally, an ERP file in the IGS ERP format can be transformed to and from different ITRF's.
The related technical paper was published in GPS Solutions, Volume 5, Number 3, Winter 2002.
